Introduction:
       This repository demonstrates Version Control skills using Git Bash & GitHub. It contains an HTML portfolio and documents Git operations.

Project Overview:
       This project focuses on understanding and implementing Git and GitHub for version control using Git Bash.
       A simple web project was created and managed through multiple commits, branches, merges, and conflict resolution to simulate real-world software development workflows.

Technologies:

       HTML
       CSS
       Git & GitHub
       Version Control
Git Concepts Demonstrated: 
       Initialize repository Commits with messages Branching Merging Merge conflict resolution Remote operations
Git Commands Used:

Step 1: Create Project Folder
              
       mkdir
       cd 


Explanation: Creates and navigates to the project directory.

Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

       git init


Explanation: Initializes an empty Git repository inside the project folder.

Step 3: Create Project Files

       touch index.html styles.css README.md


Explanation: Creates basic project files for the web project and documentation.

Step 4: Add Files to Staging Area

       git add .


Explanation: Stages all newly created and modified files for commit.

Step 5: First Commit

       git commit -m "Initial project setup"


Explanation: Saves the first snapshot of the project.

Step 6: Create Feature Branch

       git branch feature


Explanation: Creates a new branch to add new features separately.

Step 7: Switch to Feature Branch

       git checkout feature


Explanation: Switches the working directory to the feature branch.

Step 8: Add Feature Content

       git commit -am "Add portfolio content"


Explanation: Commits feature-related changes to the feature branch.

Step 9: Create Bugfix Branch

       git branch bugfix


Explanation: Creates a branch dedicated to fixing issues.

Step 10: Create Test Branch

       git branch test


Explanation: Creates a branch for testing changes before final merge.

Step 11: Create Experiment Branch

       git branch experiment


Explanation: Creates a branch to try experimental changes safely.

Step 12: Merge Feature Branch

       git merge feature


Explanation: Merges feature branch changes into the current branch.

Step 13: Merge Conflict Occurred

       <<<<<<< HEAD
       Conflicting content
       =======
       Feature content
       >>>>>>> feature


Explanation: Git detects conflicts when the same file is modified in multiple branches.

Step 14: Resolve Merge Conflict
       
       git add .
       git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"


Explanation: Marks conflicts as resolved and completes the merge.

Step 15: Create GitHub Repository

       git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/Git-bash_project.git


Explanation: Connects local repository to GitHub.

Step 16: Push Project to GitHub

       git push -u origin master

Branches:

       feature
        bugfix
        test
        experiment
Merge Conflict:

Created intentional conflict in t.HTML between test and experiment branches. Resolved manually → Final heading committed.

Challenges:

  Understanding merge conflicts
  Managing multiple branches
  
Conclusion:

This project helped me practice full Git workflow including: Local repository management Branching strategies Handling conflicts Working with GitHub remotes
